## 💡 Inspiration
Learnt how to build Python app to call OpenAI API to have the better classification. Used ChatGPT for prompt validation for multiple scenarios.

## ⚙️ What It Does
Email Classification using OpenAI and OCR text extraction

## 🛠️ How We Built It
Used Python,OCR,PyMuPDF,pandas, LangChain, gpt-3.5-turbo model.

## 🚧 Challenges We Faced
OpenAI API call limit with free tier is not useful which is exhasted immediately. I used Premium tier for the validation which is available only after billing.
